# Clerks API 👥

This is a Dockerized Rails 7 app that provides an interface to manage and retrieve `Clerk` data. The application uses the [RandomUser.com](http://randomuser.com/) API to populate the database with `Clerk` entries (initialized with random user attributes) and provides endpoints to fetch and filter the data.

Clerks API was built using:

- Ruby: `3.2.1`
- Rails: `7.0.6`
- PostgreSQL: `15.3`
- Docker: `20.10.5` & Docker-compose: `1.25.0`

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to showcase best practices, coding principles, and structuring of a Rails API application. For more information on the requirements, check: [Clerks API requirements](https://github.com/hatchways-community/7e25dd52c32e4cf3a1822a0d900665e2/tree/main#readme)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

- To install Docker, follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

- To install Docker Compose, follow the instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-1-installing-docker-compose (as it is tested using the `docker-compose` v1. Alternatively, you could try v2 version from here: https://docs.docker.com/compose but I am not sure about the `docker-compose.yml` compatibility)

All the actual application dependencies are handled by Docker. Check `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files for more info on that.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:christospi/clerks-api.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the application directory:**

    ```bash
    cd clerks-api
    ```

3. **Environment configuration:**
The application uses environment variables for configuration. A `.env.sample` file is provided in the repository as a template.
    1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to create a new `.env` file:

        ```bash
        cp .env.sample .env
        ```

    2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual values... **OR**
    3. <details>
        <summary>Use mine... 🤫🔫🔪</summary>
        
        ```
        # Database config
        POSTGRES_DB=clerks_api_development
        POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
        POSTGRES_USER=master_clerk
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass
        
        # Rails config
        RAILS_ENV=development
        RAILS_MASTER_KEY=df3fb452496d94ca83cf44ae77f829d6
        ```
    </details>     
4. **Build and start the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    The database will be prepared automatically during the startup process.


## Running the application

Once the Docker containers are up and running, Clerks-API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Running tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

This will build and start the Docker containers and run all the `rspec` tests.

## Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /populate`: Populates the database with 5K users from RandomUser API, creating a `Clerk` record for each one. It creates `Clerk` records synchronously but downloads and attaches images asynchronously (hopefully, for performance optimization). 
- `GET /clerks`: Returns a list of `Clerk` records sorted by registration date, with the most recent users appearing first. Supports optional parameters for filtering and pagination. Currently supported optional parameters:
    - `limit`: A limit on the number of Clerks to be returned, ranging between 1 and 100.
    - `starting_after`: A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is a Clerk ID that
    defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100
    objects, ending with `ID=obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
    - `ending_before`: A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is a Clerk ID that
    defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100
    objects, `starting with ID=obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
    - `email`: A case-insensitive filter on the list based on Clerk's email field.

    For a few samples, check the following section (Sample Requests and Responses).


## **Sample Requests and Responses**

This section provides examples of how to call the supported endpoints and what kind of responses you can expect.

### **Populate Clerks**

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3000/populate
```

**Response:**

Upon successful completion, this endpoint will return a status of 200 and a message indicating the operation was successful.

```json
{
  "success_count": 5,
  "total_count": 5,
  "message": "All 5 users were created successfully.",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### **Get Clerks**

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3000/clerks
```

**Response:**

This endpoint returns a list of clerks. The response contains an array of Clerk objects. Each Clerk object includes **`id`**, **`firstname`**, **`lastname`**, **`email`**, **`phone`**, **`picture`**, and **`registration_date`** fields.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 5,
    "first_name": "Annabelle",
    "last_name": "Wilson",
    "email": "annabelle.wilson@example.com",
    "phone": "(307)-178-1138",
    "registration_date": "2022-05-03T07:26:23.952Z",
    "created_at": "2023-07-29T13:34:21.247Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-07-29T13:34:21.253Z"
  },
  // ... more records
]
```

You can also use query parameters to filter and paginate the results. Here's an example that fetches Clerks with a limit of 20, starting after Clerk with ID 100:

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:3000/clerks?limit=20&starting_after=100"
```

This will return up to 20 clerks whose ID comes after 100, sorted by registration date in descending order.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Rails application structure with models, controllers, and services with a few additions. Apart from the expected classes/modules supporting our main model (`Clerk`), it includes the following:

- **Services:** Located in `lib/services` directory, these files encapsulate business logic that doesn't belong in models or controllers of our app. This includes the `RandomUser` module used to fetch user data from the [RandomUser.com](http://randomuser.com/) API. It fetches user data in batches to avoid overwhelming the API with a single large request.
- **Utilities:** General purpose helpers that may be used across different models, services, or other parts of the application (DRY is our motto here!). These utilities can be found under `lib/utils`. Currently, we only have `Downloader` module, which abstracts the process of a file download (used to fetch user pictures from RandomUser.com).
- **Serializers:** Located in the `app/serializers` directory, these files handle the conversion of data for application models. It contains `RandomUserSerializer` which is responsible for transforming data from the Random User API into a format that can be used by the `Clerk` model.
- **Jobs:** Background job classes that handle async tasks, located under `app/jobs` directory. It includes `ClerkPictureDownloadJob`, which supports downloading and attaching a picture to the passed `Clerk` record in the background. `ClerkPictureDownloadJob` current implementation is based on `ActiveJob` framework, without a persisted queueing system in backend (sorry, only RAM for now, be sure not to unplug your system).
- **Specs:** Test coverage is provided by RSpec. Located in the `spec` directory, these files contain the test suite for our application, including unit tests for models and controller actions, along with a few request tests.
- **Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml:** These files define the Docker configuration for setting up and running the application in a Docker container. It handles both our database (Postgres) and the Rails app.
- **.env.sample:** Sample configuration files for the required environment variables. Following the instructructions in **Setup** section, you should create a new local file named `.env` in application root directory with the appropriate values.

## **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues while setting up the application, you may need to rebuild your Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

You may also need to check the container logs to debug any issues:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```
